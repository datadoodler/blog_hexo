#### Webpack Notes

There are <em>many</em> options for using webpack. These notes won't be an exhaustive treatise on the subject, but merely cover how to implement webpack for my usage current scenario, namely, the [DataDoodler Administration Dashboard](https://github.com/datadoodler/datadoodler-admin-dashboard).

#### Installation

Basic webpack, and (optionally) the dev server, which provides a basic express app.

```` javascript
npm-install --save-dev webpack, webpack-dev-server
````

<!-- More -->

Loaders: Webpack assumes all files are javascript unless additional loaders are invoked to handle other file types.

npm install --save-dev css-loader style-loader


#### Running
```
webpack --devtool source-map ./entry.js bundle.js -w
```

* <b>source-map</b>: Browser will show source files individually under the "webpack/." namespace.
* <b>./entry.js</b>: The starting point. Webpack will not only compile this file, but will use it as a starting point and recursively compile any external files that it detects are dependencies.
* <b>bundle.js</b>: the target file that will receive all the Webpack goodness.
* <b>-w</b>: webpack will watch for changes and automatically recompile. 


##### More convenint to use a config file
You can use the command line to specify a lot of the options for running webpack, but using a config file is much more convenient. Webpack will look for webpack.config.js 


```
module.exports = {
    entry: "./entry.js",
    output: {
        path: __dirname,
        filename: "bundle.js"
    },
    devtool: 'source-map',
    module: {
        preLoaders: [
            {test: /\.js$/, exclude: /node_modues/, loader: 'jshint-loader'}
        ],
        loaders: [
            {test: /\.css$/, loaders: ['style','css']},
            {test: /\.html$/, loader: 'raw'}
        ]
    }
};
```



#### Install the command line interface for the webpack dev server.

```
webpack-dev-server -g
```


##### package.json

this is package.json
